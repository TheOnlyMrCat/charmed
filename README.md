# Charmed
Charmed is a text-based roguelike written in Python for a computer
game development class. The goal is to escape the dungeon with the
Charm of Relativity found on the ninth level. The random generation
is seeded, given difficulty, and balanced to be extremely difficult.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Go into System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Privacy.
Under accessibility, click the + button beneath the list.
A window will pop up showing all your applications. Find Terminal
in the Utilities folder and double-click on it.

This will allow Charmed to get keyboard events when it is running.
This is necessary because you don't want to press enter after every
movement command.

### Running
Download the repository from the downloads section in the sidebar.
Double-click on `run.command`. If you get an error message saying
the file isn't executable, navigate to the directory in terminal and
run `chmod +x run.command`. Then run it. The game then explains
the rest.
